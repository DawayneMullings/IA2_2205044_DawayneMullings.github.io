                                <h4>Strongest Trait</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I believe my stongest trait is enduring through my circumstances, Throught
                                    my academic years, this trait has proven itself reliable time and time again 
                                    as I am aware of what I am working towards and the measures I have to take to achieve
                                    them. And so, not matter how complex and tiresome the workload may become, it shall
                                    be faced as another stepping stone towards academic success.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h4>Emotion</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I try to maintain a positive emotion at all times as I believe this plays a 
                                    pivotal role between success and failure. Positive emotions like enthusiasm 
                                    and curiosity tends to lead to greater engagement with the course material 
                                    and a deeper understanding within my studies. On the other hand, managing negative 
                                    emotions such as stress or anxiety is crucial to maintain focus and mental well-being 
                                    and so this is something i am currently working on.

                                <p>
                                    Knowing how to balance hobbies and academia is quite important. However, 
                                    as the years progress, I find myself decreasing in number for hobbies as 
                                    my workload tends to increase. Currently my hobbies are shifting from 
                                    playing sports and video games and towards playing with the knowledge I gain 
                                    from my classes.

                                <p>
                                One of the persons I idolise the most is Tajeme Robbinson, my cadet superior 
                                back in high school. Tajeme never showed fear of being disliked but instead goes 
                                above and beyond to get tasks accomplished. </br></br>
                                The reason I chose to highlight Tajeme as my current role is that in this current 
                                moment, Though I have so many reasons to be doing other tasks, I have to remind 
                                myself that "Excuses are monuments of nothing, they build bridges to nowhere, and 
                                masters of excuses are simply masters of nothing themselves". </br></br> This is a quote I have 
                                have adapted from him on a camp night in 2018, I felt weak both physically as we were 
                                carrying out rather streneous tasks with a negative attitude but a fire kindled within 
                                the moment I heard the Sergeant shouted those words from the back of our rank. words that 
                                motivated me to go on finding strength from within and so this is a moment I will probably
                                remember for the rest of my life.

                                    I believ ethe test has validity in general as the characteristics presented by
                                    the test are indeed the qualities one would seek in a guardian.
                                    </br>
                                    On the hand, In my case, I would not pass the results form the test as valid as 
                                    the results boasts on my less involved characteristics and even characteristics which 
                                    I can't accept as my own.
