                                    In this chapter we see Michael deciding to take action by putting 
                                    more time in the growth of his relationship with his wif, Amy. We could 
                                    see him openly sharing his frustrations about not having a clear starting
                                    point in his pursuit of success which is something majority of us can relate to.
                                    The fourth pillar highlights the value of jotting down goals, showing how 
                                    this act breathes life into them and how the journey towards achieving these
                                    goals are often more enriching than reaching the goals themselves.

                                    chances of success are increase expected to increase. A Possible
                                    implication would be jotting down smart goals and working towards 
                                    them to become a better student of the computing discipline.
